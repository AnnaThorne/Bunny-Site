                        <h2>Water and food bowls</h2>
                        <p>Bunnies need to have acess to clean drinking water, water bowls are easy for them to drink
                            out of
                            compared to drip feeding water bottles, the kind that you might use for a hamster or other
                            smaller rodents. Ideally you'd get your bunny a heavier bowl made out of ceramics - so that
                            it's
                            not easy to tip over and spill.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="item equipment">
                        <h2>Litter tray</h2>
                        <p>A litter tray serves as a dedicated space for your bunny to poop, you should also fill it
                            with
                            some comfortable base for bunnies to sit on such as wood or paper based litter, also make
                            sure
                            that the litter tray is large enough for your bunny to sit on. </p>

                    <div class="item equipment">
                        <h2>Housing</h2>
                        <p>Housing is extremely important to bunnies, as it serves as a place for them to retreat into
                            when
                            they get scared. So it's important that your bunny is provided with a comfortable living
                            enclosure.<br><br>An essential part of a bunny's home is comfortable bedding, suitable
                            materials
                            include fresh hay, wood shavings - but no sawdust, straw and shredded paper - ink free.
                            <br><br>Ideally
                            you would provide your bunny with an indoor exercise pen with a cozy wooden cube house
                            inside
                            it. You can also combine an indoor pen with a cage as a house for your bunnies to sleep in.

                        <h2>Grooming</h2>
                        <p>Even your bunny needs a grooming kit, which should consist of a comb brush and a nail
                            clipper.<br><br> You should brush your bunny's fur once every few days, unless your bunny
                            has
                            longer
                            fur, in which case you'd need to brush it more regularly. Don't apply too much pressure on
                            the
                            brush - just enough to get through their fur and get rid of all the knots and tangles
                            without
                            scratching
                            their skin, also stay away from brushes with metal tips. <br><br>As with brushing, you
                            should
                            clip your bunny's nails regularly. Providing your bunnies with hard surfaces to play and run
                            on
                            also helps with keeping their nails trimmed.</p>

                        <h2>Hay rack</h2>
                        <p>A hay rack is essential to keep hay off the floor and it provides your bunnies easy access to
                            it.
                            A good place to put a hay rack would be either next your bunny's litter box or their living
                            enclosure.</p>

                        <h2>Toys</h2>
                        <p>Bunnies are playful creatures, as such they get enjoyment out of simple toys. The best kinds
                            of
                            toys for your bunny are: chew toys, digging boxes, foraging mats, puzzle cups, hideaway
                            tents
                            and climbing towers. </p>
