                            <p>Hailing from France, the Blanc de Hotot is a medium-sized rabbit breed, with its
                                signature black rings around each eye, their fur is also always white. <br><br>Nowadays
                                they're
                                considered an endagered species, but they've been becoming more popular with rabbit
                                owners in recent years.</p>

                                playful. <br><br> Another plus is that they actually have quite a long lifespan -

                                a friendly and easy-going personality, however, they are especially prone to being

                                the other breeds.<br><br> They're also one of the more intelligent rabbit breeds and are
                                extremely energetic. Lastly, they tend to be prone towards getting stressed and nervous,

                                brown. <br><br>They require a lot of room to move around, so that they don't step on

                                When it comes to personality, they tend to be curious and outgoing.</p>

                            <p>As the name suggest, this kind of bunny is one of the largest breeds. Their coats always
                                come in white, with a distinct black pattern around the nose, ears and the back. They're
                                a bit more independent than other breeds, so they don't require as much
                                attention.<br><br>
                                They're also gentle and are a good fit for people who don't have as much time to spend
                                with their bunny. However, do keep in mind that, due to their larger size, they might
                                require a bit more room to move around.</p>
