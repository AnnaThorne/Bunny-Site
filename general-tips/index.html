                    <div class="item general">
                        <h2>Change your bunny's hay and water</h2>
                        <p>You should change your bunny's water supply twice a day and provide it with fresh hay on a
                            daily
                            basis. Hay is extremely important for bunnies as a source of fiber - helps
                            with digestion and it helps to keep their teeth in a healthy shape. The best kind of hay is
                            grass or oat hay.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="item general">
                        <h2>Pay attention to your bunny's diet</h2>
                        <p>As mentioned before, hay is actually the most important part of a healthy bunny's diet,
                            however,
                            it's not the only part of it. You should also feed your bunny a healthy mix of vegetables
                            and
                            fruit such as broccoli, melon, bananas, dark leaf lettuce, apples and of course carrots. Hay
                            pellets can also be given to bunnies in smaller quantities. Lastly, don't forget to give
                            your
                            bunny treats from time to time - freeze dried fruit and dried flowers.</p>

                    <div class="item general">
                        <h2>Make sure that your bunny has access to clean water</h2>
                        <p>This might sound obvious, but it's actually really important for a bunny to have access to
                            clean
                            water, they get more easily dehydrated compared to other species of their size - an average
                            bunny consumes more water than a dog. So it's definitely not something to skip out on.</p>

                    <div class="item general">
                        <h2>Give your bunny enough room</h2>
                        <p>Bunnies are active animals that need a lot of room for them to healthily exercise and play
                            in.
                            The best possible evnironment for them would be a sectioned off area of your house,
                            specifically
                            for your bunnies - yes even an entire room. Providing them access to your garden is also a
                            good
                            idea, however, be wary of wild predators as bunnies can't defend themselves.</p>

                    <div class="item general">
                        <h2>Leave your bunny alone</h2>
                        <p>Bunnies are social creatures that rely on interaction to keep them from being lonely and
                            bored. A
                            single bunny can be left alone for up to 12 hours, afterwards it can become distressed
                            and suffer. However, if you have two or more bunnies, they'll be able to keep each other
                            company
                            for up to a weekend. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="item general">
                        <h2>Keep your bunny in a cage</h2>
                        <p>While it's ok to put your bunny in a carrying cage for a short vet visit, cages aren't a
                            suitable
                            evnironment for them to be in for extended periods of time. Bunnies need enough space to
                            comfortably run around and exercise. Keeping them in a cage long-term has detrimental
                            effects to
                            their physical but also mental health, being stuck in a small enclosed space just isn't fun
                            to
                            them.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="item general">
                        <h2>Feed your bunny human food</h2>
                        <p>While bunnies can consume most fruit and vegetables, they aren't allowed to eat regular human
                            food and treats. That means no chocolate, no cookies or crackers, no pasta, no sugar, no
                            yogurt, no beans and no cereal. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="item general">
                        <h2>Put your bunny in a loud environment</h2>
                        <p>Bunnies are naturally prey animals, that means they are prone to getting scared and wanting
                            to
                            hide. Which also means they are easily scared by loud noises, however, bunnies can get
                            adjusted
                            to louder evnironments if they feel like there is no direct threat to them. </p>
