                        <h2>Hay</h2>
                        <p>Hay makes up the bulk of a bunny's diet - around 80-90%. It's necessary to keep their teeth
                            healthy, and more importantly, it's a source of fiber, which helps bunnies with
                            digestion.<br><br>The
                            best kind of hay for adult bunnies is grass hay, oat hay, timothy hay or orchard grass. You
                            can
                            even give your bunny a mixture of different types of hay. Baby bunnies can also consume
                            alfalfa
                            hay, because of it's higher sugar content.
                            <br><br>Make sure that the hay is fresh and. doesn't contain mold. The hay should be stored
                            in a
                            dry place, so that it doesn't get wet and moldy. It's also a good idea to leave a source of
                            hay
                            next to your bunny's litterbox, as they like to eat and poop at the same time.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Vegetables</h2>
                        <p>
                            Vegetables are some of the favorite food for bunnies. In general, most greens are safe with
                            the
                            exception of beans, seeds, nuts corn and potatoes - they're difficult for bunnies to
                            digest.<br><br>Some of the best vegetables for bunnies include bell peppers, brussel
                            sprouts,
                            cucumbers, herbs, sprouts, wheatgrass, zucchini, celery, dandelion leaves and dark leaf
                            lettuce. These can be safely given to bunnies on a daily basis.<br><br>
                            Then there are some vegetables that should be given to bunnies sparingly - once or twice a
                            week:
                            broccoli, carrots, clover, flowers, kale and spinach.<br><br>
                            You should introduce your bunny to vegetables slowly, let them try one new veeggie a day and
                            see
                            which ones they like the most. You should also remember that, while bunnies enjoy vegetables
                            and
                            they are healthy for them, they don't replace hay and it should still be their main source
                            of
                            food - vegetables should be used more sparingly, once or twice a day.

                        <h2>Fruit</h2>
                        <p>
                            Similarly to vegetables, you should introduce your bunnies to new fruit slowly and let them
                            decide which types of fruit they like the most. It's also important to note that, you should
                            only give your bunnies fruit one to two times a week, as it is high in sugar. <br><br>The
                            best
                            fruits to give to your bunny include: apples, bananas, berries, cherries without seeds,
                            grapes,
                            nectarines, melons, oranges, papayas, peaches, pears, pineapples, plums, watermelon.<br><br>
                            In
                            general, bunnies prefer seedless fruit, or fruit with seeds that are small enough to safely
                            consume. Be careful not to give your bunny too much fruit, it's important for them to keep a
                            balanced diet.

                    <div class="item feeding">
                        <h2>Treats</h2>
                        <p>
                            Treats are less about a bunny's diet and more about making it happy and giving it a reward,
                            as
                            such, treats should be used very sparingly.<br><br>
                            The healthiest kind of treats for bunnies are pieces of fresh or freeze-dried fruit and
                            mixes of
                            dried flowers. You can also find pre-made bunny treats at pet stores - just check the
                            ingredient
                            list to make sure they're actually safe.

                    <div class="item feeding">
                        <h2>Pellets</h2>
                        <p>
                            Pellets are another kind of bunny food, they act as a supplement to hay, but they should not
                            be
                            used as a replacement. You should only give your bunny pellets with high fiber and low
                            protein,
                            as high protein pellets can cause health issues in bunnies.
                        </p>

                    <div class="item feeding">
                        <h2>Water</h2>
                        <p>
                            As with hay, bunnies should have unrestricted access to clean water, because it's important
                            for them to stay hydrated. A single bunny consumes
                            anywhere from 50 to 150 ml of water per day, which is higher than most animals of its size.
